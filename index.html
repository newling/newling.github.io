Hello! I am James Newling. Welcome to my personal website.

<h4>Summary:</h4>

In February 2018 I graduated with a PhD 
from the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_top">
École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a> in machine learning.
Prior to that I studied (mostly) mathematics in Europe and South Africa. 
I enjoy learning and teaching mathematics, algorithm development, 
AI research, and programming (C++, Python, a bit of html!).

</br>
</br>

My PhD was advised by
<a href="http://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/" target="_top">
Francois Fleuret </a>
at the 
<a href="https://www.idiap.ch/" target="_top">
Idiap Research Institute</a>.
My thesis was on partitional clustering, 
a sub-field of unsupervised machine learning.
During my PhD I did an internship with AMD, 
developing fast matrix multiplication kernels,
which ignited my interest in specialized hardware for
accelerating machine learning algorithms. 

</br>
</br>

As of March 2018 I am a software engineer at 
<a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/" target="_top">Graphcore</a>.
