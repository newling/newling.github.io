Hello! Welcome to my webpage.

<h4><u>Personal summary</u></h4>
In February 2018 I graduated with a PhD 
from the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_top">
École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a> in machine learning.
Prior to that I studied (mostly) math in South Africa and Europe. 
I enjoy learning and teaching math, developing algorithms, doing AI research, 
and programming (C++, Python, and a bit of html!).

</br>
</br>

My PhD was advised by
<a href="http://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/" target="_top">François Fleuret</a>
at the 
<a href="https://www.idiap.ch/" target="_top">
Idiap Research Institute</a>.
My thesis was on partitional clustering, 
a type of unsupervised machine learning.
During my PhD I did an internship at 
<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/newsroom" target="_top">AMD</a>
in Austin, developing fast matrix multiply kernels,
which sparked my interest in specialized hardware 
for accelerating deep learning algorithms. 

</br>
</br>

As of March 2018 I am a software engineer at 
<a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/" target="_top">Graphcore</a>.
